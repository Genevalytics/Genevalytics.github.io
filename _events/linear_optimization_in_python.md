Linear programming is an important tool in the data scientist's toolbelt. In this presentation, we will use an example from the petroleum industry to introduce linear programming, demonstrating the important components of a linear model, how to set up your model, how to take a non-linear problem and convert it into a linear one, and how to use binary decision variables. We will be using the [pyomo](https://www.pyomo.org/) Python library.
