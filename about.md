title: About us

We are excited to announce the launch of Genevalytics, a new speaker series in Geneva for professionals, students and beginners alike to learn and share knowledge about the latest methods, techniques, technologies and applications of statistics, machine learning and data analysis. Our goal is to organize hands-on presentations on a semi-regular basis. It is an opportunity for everyone to come and present something they know or to learn from others and to discuss and exchange ideas. 

Interested in learning more, contributing to the organization, or giving a talk? Please contact us!
